What is magsph
--------------
magsph is a small proof of concept for a magneto-hydrodynamical code in smooth
particle hydrodynamics (SPMHD). While it contains 2D and 3D code, it was only
ever tested in 1D because the project it was part of was abandoned at that
point.

This software is only provided as an example of using OCaml for a
hydrodynamical problem. It is most likely not useful for anything other than
to be studied as a simple OCaml project.
